- Hi! I'm Sofia Elenga
- I graduated summa cum laude from SDSU in 2025 with a BS in Computer Science
- Summer 2025 I'm moving to NYC to work @Amazon on the Prime Video Ads team! 
- I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects + build technical skills
- Fun fact: miniosushi has been my username for everything since moshi monsters in 2nd grade (and yes I love sushi)
